# Singapore-Airbnb
There are only 3 files of interest in this repository

## listings.csv
This contains the data for Singapore Airbnb

## sg_airbnb.py
This contains the script I used to run in Spyder IDE for testing since it has a console to run your commands and a variable explorer to keep track of your variables and variable type. Use this for your testing purposes

## sg_airbnb_notebook.ipynb
This contains the plots and visualizations so you don't have to run the script to see them

Enjoy!
